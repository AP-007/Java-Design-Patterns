# Design Patterns
[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) are generic solutions to commonly occuring Software Engineering problems.

Following are some of the perks of design patterns;
  -Large Scale Reusablity	 
  -Tested and Proven
  -Easy to comprehend 

There are various types of design patterns that addesses different problems in software engineering;
 1. Gang Of Four Patterns
    - Creational
    - Structural
    - Behavioral
 2. Concurrency Patterns
 3. Architectural Patterns
 4. Other Patterns

Gang of Four patterns are the set of classic software design  patterns, described in the book *'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software'* written by; Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.


### Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns deals with problems related to object creation.
Singleton, Factory, Abstract-Factory, Builder and Prototype are some of the commonly used Creational design patterns 

**Singleton** is used when we want to retrict object creation to only one single instance. Exactly one single object of a Singleton can be created. The concept can be more generalized to restrict the instantiation to a certain no of objects
